# J.B.D.T-
J.B.D.T. stands for: Java Bytecode Descendant Translator. 

This piece of software written in Java is able to translate a language represented by high-level syntax into a mnemonic output that associates the Java bytecode 1: 1 instructions. It is possible to set in/out paths and run the entire program through the main class. 

It is also possible to translate the mnemonic output in java binary 
bytecode using Jasmine running the following command: java -jar jasmin.jar 'output_path'. 
The grammar of the language and the lexer specifications are contained in the pdf associated with the repository.
